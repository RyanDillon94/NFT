## My process
- Started with HTML and then CSS, set up the basic outlay of words and basic structure. Had to swap back and forth between Mobile and Laptop but this was great to refresh my memory.
- Once i had the basics set up, began with styling and tweaking.
- Used ChatGPT to reformat my code and make it clearer.
- Also used ChatGPT when i got stuck or couldnt remember certain bits.

### Built with
- VSCode
- ACode (Mobile)
- CSS

### What I learned
- Easy to forget silly little things when you haven't done it for a while.
- Think moving forward i will try and structure my CSS so i have broken down sections for Typography, images, sections etc.

### Continued development
Just need to get back into doing this coding development and get back up to speed before moving back onto JS
